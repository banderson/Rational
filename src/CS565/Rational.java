/*
 * Write a program to test your class. 
 * Use integer variables to represent the private instance variables of the class Ð the numerator and the denominator. 
 * Provide a constructor which enables an object of this class to be initialized when it is declared. 
 * The constructor should store the fraction in reduced form.  The fraction 2/4 is equivalent to one-half and would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator.  
 * Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided.
