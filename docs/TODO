Algorithms:
The constructor should store the fraction in reduced form (apply Euclid's algorithm)

Methods: 
c) Multiply two rational numbers: The result of the multiplication should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.
d) Divide two rational numbers: The result of the division should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.  (JM: What do you do about division by zero.)
g) Provide formatting capabilities that enable the user of the class to specify the number of digits of precision to the right of the decimal point.)
h) Add way to find LCD to convert operands for Add & Subtract
i) Reduce result from Add & Subtract
